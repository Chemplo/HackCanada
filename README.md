# HackCanada

In order to install the dependencies, first go into the roomies folder and run "npm install"
Then, go into the backend folder and continuously use "python user.py" to figure out which libraries to install

Now you may boot up the backend using "python user.py" (make sure you are still in the backend folder)
At the same time, you can also start the frontend by navigating to the roomies folder and using "npm start"

Now you can test all the features (many bugs)
